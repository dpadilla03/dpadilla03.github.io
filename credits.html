        This website was made for Stanford's CS109 class extra credit challenge. The source code and algorithms were all designed by me. The UI/Website design itself was also designed by me, however given that 
        I had no prior HTML, CSS, or javascript experience, I did use tutorials from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaVNP3nIAv0&t=1014s">freeCodeCamp.org</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz0aGYrrlhU">Programming with Mosh</a>.
        Image credit below.
        Special thanks to the CS109 staff for helping me debug! This challenge was a lot of fun, and I got to learn a little bit of web development too! ðŸ˜€
