# This was an extra credit project made for CS109. I am aware the CSS, HTML, and JS are not the prettiest as I had coded the original version in pycharm without a UI/website. This was my first attempt at HTML/CSS/JS, so I am going to improve in the future.
# Works on mobile, but not as well, I reccomend playing it on desktop. Additionally, give it at least one playthrough before reading the writeup


# The ORIGINAL version and source code is in bayesianRPS.py. This document has the most updated and detailed code comments as I tested the math and logic in python. The js file has identical functions, and some extra ones to work with the html, but to avoid the extra noise I included all relevant functions and comments on this file. It is the MOST DESCRIPTIVE version of the algorithm, again the bayes.js version was simply a translated version made to work with HTML, CSS, and Web elements. Any analysis of the code should be done on this file, NOT the .js version. Feel free to copy the code into your own python compiler and play around with it!
